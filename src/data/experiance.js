        description: "At Awareness Athletics Inc., I was in charge of working on their Slo-pitch for Awareness brand website. Over my years working there, I was their only web developer for quite some time. During this time, I developed their multi-use website. They are unique needs for their site. They not only ran softball events but also sold merchandise. Their end-user was mainly people between 26-45, with and split of 60% males, 39% females, and 1% non-binary identifying. So their design must be kept simple to use, clean, and without a clear divide between the two marketplaces. At the time, the owner wanted to build a reliable clothing brand for softball players. This gave me much experience and UX research, trying to find out what their customer's needs and the problems this site could fix. It also allowed me to learn and develop my UX design and writing skills after taking the google grows course. They run hundreds of events every year and are marketed mainly on social. Their site had to be fast and reliable. For this, I used a NoSQL database known as MongoDB to store and recall their data. I built them a dashboard in which they could easily manage every aspect of their site, from post products to managing inventory. They could even manage events and registrations within the same dashboard. I'm proud to say that this was one of the best places I could develop my skills. I look forward to creating beautiful websites and custom user flow for others who may need it.",
